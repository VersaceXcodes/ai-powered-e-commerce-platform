-- Since no schema or requirements were provided, and all schemas are empty,
-- This script creates a minimal "status" table for demonstration and further 
-- extension. Adjust or expand as soon as real requirements/schemas are specified.
--

-- DROP tables if already exists (for idempotency during develop/test only)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS status;

-- Baseline example: a status table anyone can extend
CREATE TABLE status (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

-- Example seed data for status table
INSERT INTO status (name, description) VALUES
('active', 'Entity is active and available'),
('inactive', 'Entity is inactive and unavailable'),
('pending', 'Entity is created but pending approval'),
('deleted', 'Entity is deleted or archived');

-- 
-- Since schema is empty, further table structure will need to be specified 
-- to go beyond this point. Please provide schemas for comprehensive work!
